Dear opensource gurus,

I am honored to present to you my project, Miranda, which is a framework that was developed through my own thoughts, 
reasoning, and extensive personal research.

- One of the primary objectives of Miranda is to use the "LESS code" philosophy, which means that the code has been designed
  to be concise and easy to understand. This framework is intended to simplify the way people perceive code and accommodate 
  programmers of all levels, including those who are just starting.

In order to achieve this objective, I have focused on making the framework less CLI, less configuration-oriented, and less WEB-like. 
My ultimate goal is to create an API that is accessible to all programmers, regardless of their experience level, and to reduce any 
code-intimidation they may feel.

		IMPORTANT

It is important to note that while the code may not adhere to all software engineering techniques and principles, especially OOP, and 
may not comply with PEP-8 Python guidelines, I am always looking to learn and improve. Therefore, I encourage you to provide feedback 
and suggestions for re-design or modification where necessary.

Thank you for your attention, and I hope that my project will be of great benefit to the programming community.
