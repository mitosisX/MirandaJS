Name: Miranda.js framework
Developed by: Omega Msiska (mitosisx)

Miranda.js is generally (put in simple terms) a much rather simplified version of Electron.js, with an exception of the 
HTML 5 and CSS to accomodate almost all levels of programming experience... well, coz I suck at CSS ;-)
    - Ofcourse, the framework

** PS: I wouldn't say I am a pro or anything of that that sort, butI am what some would call, an "ideas-man"; I work hard
utilizing my level of experience to design and develop practical projects, but I am always eager to learn and improve.

        ----------------

You would notice that the project lacks many PEP-8 standards and OOP priciples of many software engineering principles; I am working
on that.
