		NOTE

- The framework is a product of my own thoughts and research. No knowledge from some working-third-party framework was used as a stepping stone for my own implementation.


** The framework uses LESS-API (the less code the better)

- Miranda is a project that I wish to seriously simplify the way people look at code. I wish for it to
  accomodate programmers of almost all levels regardless of whether it's their first time or not.

 - My plan is to make it as less CLI, less configuration and as less WEB-like as possible.

- I wish even for first-time programmers to feel less intimidated by it's API.

P.S: I understand the code lacks MANYYY software engineering techniques and principles (especially OOP), and doesn't comply to many
	 PEP-8 python guidelines... as I am still learning. BUT, I wish to learn from everyone of you.

	 Re-design or modify the code where necessary.
