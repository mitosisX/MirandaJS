Hello everyone,

I am excited to share with you a project that I have been working on for quite some time now. It is an open-source project that aims to develop a cross-platform JavaScript desktop development framework in Python.

As a developer myself, I understand the importance of having a reliable and efficient desktop development framework that can work seamlessly across multiple platforms. That is why I have dedicated my time and effort to creating a framework that can meet these requirements.

However, as much as I have put into this project, most of the code is spaghetti, but I believe that there is still room for improvement. This includes code refactoring, utilization of OOP principles and use of PEP-8 guidelines, and that is where I need your help. I am extending an invitation to anyone who would like to contribute to this project and make it even better.

If you have any experience in Python or JavaScript, or any related fields, and you would like to contribute to the project, please feel free to do so. Your contribution could be in the form of code, testing, documentation, or anything else that you think could be helpful.

I understand that this project may not be as professional as some of the other projects out there, but I assure you that it is a worthwhile endeavor. Together, we can make this framework a reliable and efficient tool for developers everywhere.

Thank you for considering this invitation, and I hope to see some of you contributing to this project soon.
